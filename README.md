Purpose:
AIP blog app built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

Coding Style:
  1. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
  2. Variables should be in camel case starting with lower case letter (e.g. camelCase not CamelCase).
  3. React component file should all start with capital letter (e.g. Component.js).
  4. Give variable a meaningful name stating its purpose.
  5. Don't abbreviable variable names.
  6. Avoid defining global variables if possible.
  7. The length of each line should not be longer than 80 characters. If it is the case,
     wrap it onto a new line.
  8. Use "const" to declare variables that won't change or be re-assigned.
  9. Use "let" to declare variables that live in local scope only, will change or be re-assigned.
  10. Stateless React component should be created using functional statements (e.g. use "function" keyword
      instead of "class").
  11. Client-side code (React) should use "import" and "export" statements to import or export modules.
  12. Server-side code (Node and Express) should use "require()" and "module.exports" statements to
      import or export modules.
  13. Each function should have a commemt to clearly explain its function.
  14. Multi-line comment should use "/* \*/" instead of "//".
  15. Give each React component a meaningful name.
